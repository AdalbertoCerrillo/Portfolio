    name: 'Adalberto Cerrillo Vázquez',
    role: 'Software Engineer',
    bio: 'Full-stack software engineer building backend services, cloud infrastructure, and AI systems. At Radii Manufacturing I design the services behind core manufacturing workflows, build cloud workers on AWS and Azure that automate data processing, develop AI agents with LangGraph and LangChain, and maintain the CI/CD pipelines and observability that hold a microservices platform together. I work across Python, Java, JavaScript and C#, with Django, Spring Boot and React, and my interests run to distributed systems, event-driven architecture, LLM systems and RAG, and platform engineering. I trained as a software engineer at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas. What drives me is continuous innovation — using emerging technology to shape where the software industry is going, and combining engineering with design and business thinking to build solutions that last.',
